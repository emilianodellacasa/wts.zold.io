  Even though we keep this private RSA key in our database, it can't be used to send out money from your wallet,
  because the
  = succeed ',' do
    %a{href: 'https://blog.zold.io/2018/07/18/keygap.html'} keygap
  a small and important part of it, has been extracted and given to you (marked with red stars).
  Every time you make a new payment we ask you to provide it.
  Thus, even if our database gets hacked and/or stolen, your wallet is safe.
